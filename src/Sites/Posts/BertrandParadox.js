                <section className={"articleInfo"}>
                    Bertrand's Paradox is a classic problem in probability theory that questions the definition of randomness. It asks: "What is the probability that a randomly chosen chord in a circle is longer than the side of an inscribed equilateral triangle?" Interestingly, depending on the method used to select the chord, the probability can vary, leading to different interpretations and solutions.

                        <p>
                            As part of my education, I needed to complete an exercise using JavaFX. I wanted to choose a project that would not only help me practice JavaFX but also deepen my understanding of any mathematical concept. While searching for a suitable problem, I came across Bertrand's Paradox.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It presents a challenge in probability theory. Bertrandâ€™s Paradox demonstrates how different methods of defining "randomness" can lead to varying probabilities for the same question.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By implementing a simulation of this paradox, I was able to improve my programming skills, particularly in JavaFX, while also gaining a deeper appreciation for the complexities of probability theory. This project allowed me to visualize mathematical concepts dynamically, reinforcing both my coding abilities and my mathematical intuition.

                        <p>
                            Bertrand's Paradox is a famous problem in probability theory that challenges our understanding of randomness. It explores the probability of a randomly selected chord in a circle being longer than the side of an inscribed equilateral triangle. What makes this paradox fascinating is that the solution can vary depending on how the chord is chosen, highlighting the ambiguity in the definition of "random."

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Random Endpoints Method:</b><br />Two random points are selected independently on the circumference of the circle, and a chord is drawn between them.</li>
                            <li><b>Random Radius Method:</b><br />A radius is drawn at a random angle, and a point is chosen randomly along this radius. A perpendicular chord is then drawn through this point.</li>
                            <li><b>Random Midpoint Method:</b><br />A point inside the circle is chosen randomly to be the midpoint of the chord, and the chord is drawn through this point.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Each of these methods leads to a different probability of the chord being longer than the side of the inscribed equilateral triangle, making Bertrand's Paradox a fascinating example of how varying definitions of randomness can yield different results.

                            The Random Endpoints Method involves selecting two random points on the circumference of a circle and connecting them to form a chord. To understand the probability of the chord being longer than the side of an inscribed equilateral triangle, we need to delve into the geometry and the mathematical process behind the method.

                            The circle can be described using polar coordinates, where any point on the circumference is given by the angle <Latex>{"$\\theta$"}</Latex>. We can use the angle to describe the position of each point. The length of the chord will depend on the central angle <Latex>{"$\\Delta \\theta$"}</Latex> between the two points.

                            The first point is located at an angle <Latex>{"$\\theta_1$"}</Latex> on the circle.<br/>
                            The second point is located at an angle <Latex>{"$\\theta_2$"}</Latex> on the circle.<br/>
                            Since the points are chosen randomly, the angle <Latex>{"$\\Delta \\theta = |\\theta_2 - \\theta_1|$"}</Latex> is the key factor that determines the length of the chord.

                            The Midpoint Method involves selecting a random point inside the circle and then drawing a chord whose midpoint is the selected point. To calculate the probability of the chord being longer than the side of an inscribed equilateral triangle, we need to examine the geometry and the relationship between the distance of the midpoint from the center of the circle and the length of the chord.

The radius of the circle is <Latex>{"$r$"}</Latex>, and we denote the radial distance from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord as <Latex>{"$d$"}</Latex>. The key idea is that the length of the chord depends on the distance of the midpoint from the center of the circle.

                            The inequality shows that for the chord to be longer than the side of the inscribed equilateral triangle, the perpendicular distance <Latex>{"$d$"}</Latex> must satisfy:
                        </p>
                        <p className={"textAlignCenter equation"}>
                            <Latex>{"$d < \\frac{r}{2}$"}</Latex>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since <Latex>{"$d$"}</Latex> is chosen randomly from 0 to <Latex>{"$r$"}</Latex>, the probability of <Latex>{"$d$"}</Latex> being less than <Latex>{"$\\frac{r}{2}$"}</Latex> corresponds to the fraction of the area where this condition holds. The probability is given by:
                        </p>
                        <p className={"textAlignCenter equation"}>
                            <Latex>{"$P(d < \\frac{r}{2}) = \\frac{\\frac{r}{2}}{r} = \\frac{1}{2}$"}</Latex>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen chord using the Radius Method is longer than the side of the inscribed equilateral triangle is <Latex>{"$\\frac{1}{2}$"}</Latex>.

                            The application is a Simulation of the Bertrand Paradox. The simulation allows the user to choose the method used to select the chord, the number of iterations, and the delay between the drawing. It allows the user to visualize the probability of the chord being longer than the side of the inscribed equilateral triangle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After Starting the Algorithm, the lines will be generated and the probability will be calculated. Lines longer than the side of the inscribed equilateral triangle will be colored red, while the shorter ones will be colored blue.
